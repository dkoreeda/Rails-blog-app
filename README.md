# Rails Blawg

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BDDQCaXmBrhCg/giphy.gif)

This homework's gonna be .... off the rails (is that a good thing or bad thing? Let it be whatever you'd like)

Time to get Rails experience, or else Kanye might never hire you. And if you don't like Kanye, maybe you can get a job with Justin Bieber, Gwyneth Paltrow or someone else universally beloved.

## Setup

Ain't nobody got time for files

## Completion

Do it.  Do it all.  Do it with vengeance.  Do it for your family honor.


## Assignment

### User Stories

#### Part 1: Add and Delete Posts
You're creating your very own Blog App in Rails! A user should be able to:
* Land on a welcome page
* See all existing posts
* Create a new post (a post should have an author and content)
* View individual posts

#### Part 2: Commenting on Posts
Add functionality to your blog so that:
* A user can add comments to posts from a form on the individual posts page.
* A user can delete comments



----

#### Approach

Do this with RAILS! What's the general approach we use here?

* Plan what each action should do
* Initialize a new app (don't forget the flags!)
* Create a database
* Create migrations/model files
* Migrate a schema
* Seed as necessary
* Create routes
* Create corresponding controllers and controller actions
* Create welcome view
* Render JSON responses
* Create front-end JS (where should it go?)
